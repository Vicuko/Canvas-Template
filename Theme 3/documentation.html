            In order to be able to fully use all the options available for this
            template, you will have to be able to modify some of the parts
            contained in the html files that compose the template, as well as
            the css which defines characteristics of the template such as the
            colors used for each part, from the navigation bar to the buttons.

            <p>
              This template is based on several HTML files that you may view in
              the files section within Canvas.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc1.png"
            />
            <p>
              In order to customize the template to your needs and content, you
              will have to modify these html files, but no worries, it is quite
              an easy task to accomplish.
              <br />
              <br />
              Let's start by learning how to view the content within these
              files. So download one of the HTML files as well as the
              general.css file and keep reading.
              <br />
              <br />
              In order to access the HTML (or CSS) content there are several
              options available depending on your operating system. Here I will
              explain the basic options available for both Windows and MacOS. If
              your operating system is different from these, I'm sure there will
              be a similar option available.
              <br />
              <br />
              My recommendation here is to download a <b>code editor</b>. There
              are great options and many of them for free. So if you don't mind
              downloading one, skip right to the "Code Editor" part. If, on the
              other hand, you would rather not download any program, in both
              operating systems you may view the content in the default text
              editor pre-installed by default in every computer. Right below I
              explain how you may open HTML files in these editors. There are
              also <b>online options</b> that let you both modify the files and
              view the results at the same time. If you're interested in these
              ones, you may skip directly to the "Online editor" section.
            </p>

            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <p>
              In the case of Windows, you may open the HTML file using the
              "Notepad". You can do this by right clicking on the HTML file and
              then Open with > Notepad:
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2.png"
            />
            <p>
              If you can't see the "Notepad" option, the you can click on
              "Choose another app" and the find the Notepad application and use
              it for opening the file.
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3.png"
            />
            <img class="mb-4" src="../images/Documentation/doc4.png" />
            <p>
              Once you have opened the file you should be able to see the HTML
              code in the file where you will be able to make all of the changes
              to your website:
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5.png"
            />

            <h3>MacOS</h3>
            <p>
              In the case of MacOS, you may open the HTML file using the
              "TextEdit". To do so, you will have to first open the TextEdit
              app. You may do this by opening spotlight and simply type
              "TextEdit".
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc6.png"
            />
            <p>
              Once you have opened TextEdit, click on the top menu on File >
              Open.
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc7.png"
            />
            <p>
              The find the HTML file you want to open, select it, click on the
              bottom on the "Options" button and select "Ignore rich text
              commands" and then click on the "Open" button.
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc8.png"
            />
            <p>
              Once you have opened the file you should be able to see the HTML
              code in the file where you will be able to make all of the changes
              to your website:
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc9.png"
            />

            <h3>Code Editor</h3>
            <p>
              In case you would like to use a Code Editor, there are many
              options in the market. My curretn recommendation is
              <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
                >Visual Studio Code</a
              >
              which you may download from their official website.
              <br />
              <br />
              These editors have many advantages, such as highlighting the
              different parts of the code so that you may see more clearly what
              you are looking for. Also, there are many plugins you may add that
              will help you edit and creat things faster. Here is how you could
              see the same content as I previously showed in the text editors:
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc10.png"
            />
            <p>
              [In this image the code is colored using the Monokai template]
              <br />
              <br />
              To open the file you may follow the same steps as defined earlier
              for both Windows and MacOs switch using the corresponding code
              editor instead of the "Notepad" or "TextEdit" applications.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once you are done editing the file, you may view the results in
              your browser before uploading it to Canvas, this way you can make
              sure that what you are uploading is what you expect it to be.
              <br />
              <br />
              Probably the system will have identified the .html extension for
              the file and suggest opening it with a browser, so simply by
              double clicking on the file, it should open up in the browser
              itself. If it doesn't, then you can either drag and drop the file
              over the browser or right click on the file and choose to open it
              with the browser of your choice.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once you have opened the file in the browser, you should be able
              to see the final design:
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc11.png"
            />
            <p>
              <b>Important!</b>: Remember to include the "general.css" as well
              at the same level as the html files, since the css includes the
              styling for the different html files, otherwise the page may be
              shown differently than in Canvas.
            </p>
            <h3>Online Editor</h3>
            <p>
              In case you would like to use an Online Editor, there are as well
              several options available for free. One of the options I tend to
              use more is
              <a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank">replit</a>.
              <br />
              <br />
              First you will have to create an account and then once you're in
              your dashboard, you may follow the next steps to load the content.
              <br />
              <br />
              On your dashboard, click on the plus sign button of the create
              section.
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc12.png"
            />
            <p>
              On the modal that will open up, choose the HTML, CSS, JS option
              and give your repl a name. Then click on the create repl button.
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc13.png"
            />
            <p>
              You will now see a new project that has been filled up with 3
              different files. 1 HTML file (.html), 1 CSS file (.css) and 1
              JavaScript file (.js). You can simply ignore those.
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc14.png"
            />
            <p>
              We will now proceed to upload the html files from the template.
              Click on the "upload file" option as shown in the image below and
              upload the files you wish to view/edit:
            </p>
            <img class="mb-4" src="../images/Documentation/doc15.png" />
            <p>
              <b>Important!</b>: Remember to include the "general.css" as well
              at the same level as the html files, since the css includes the
              styling for the different html files.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once you have uploaded the html files and the general.css file you
              should end up with something like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc16.png"

              You may see that like in the downloadable code editor, the
              different parts of the code have different colors, making it
              easier to read and find what you are looking for within the code.
              Once you are done making any modifications to the content of the
              page, you may click on the "Run" button at the top of the screen
              and then you'll be able to see the resulting website on the right
              panel:

            <p>
              Given this template is based on HTML & CSS files, the first thing
              we will have to do is to upload these files into the Files section
              within Canvas and then click on the upload button on the top right
              corner.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-1.png"
            />
            <p>
              Once you have the html file for the corresponding page and the css
              in the same folder, the content should loook something like the
              following:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-2.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now, if you click on the html file, you should be able to view the
              content of the web page:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-3.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now, in order to show this content within a Canvas page, we will
              have to do the following.
              <br />
              <br />
              First, access the Pages section within Canvas and click on the
              "+Page" button on the top right:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-4.png"
            />
            <p>
              When creating a page, give the page the name you prefer and then
              click on the "Switch to html editor" button on the bottom right
              side of the content field:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-5.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now copy and paste the following code into the editor:
              <br />
              <br />
              <samp
                >&lt;div&gt;
                <br />
                &lt;iframe id="inlineFrameExample" style="height: 100vh; width:
                100%" title="Inline Frame Example"
                src="../file_contents/course%20files/<b>Folder%20Name%201/Folder%20Name%202</b>/filename.html"
                allow="fullscreen"
                data-api-endpoint="../file_contents/course%20files/<b>Folder%20Name%201/Folder%20Name%202</b>/filename.html"
                data-api-returntype="File" &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
                <br />
                &lt;/div &gt;
              </samp>
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-6.png"
            />
            <p>
              Here, you will need to replace the parts in bold with the
              corresponding folder structure where your file is stored. Spaces
              in between words will need to be replaced with "%20". Let's take a
              look at an example:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-7.png"
            />
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Here, the files are stored in the following folders route: Example
              1 > Example 2 > frontpage.html. Therefore, the code to include in
              the page should look like this:
              <br />
              <br />
              <samp
                >&lt;div&gt;
                <br />
                &lt;iframe id="inlineFrameExample" style="height: 100vh; width:
                100%" title="Inline Frame Example"
                src="../file_contents/course%20files/<b>Example%201/Example%202</b>/frontpage.html"
                allow="fullscreen"
                data-api-endpoint="../file_contents/course%20files/<b>Example%201/Example%202</b>/frontpage.html"
                data-api-returntype="File" &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
                <br />
                &lt;/div &gt;
              </samp>
              <br />
              <br />
              The result should be something like the following:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-8.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now, if you try to switch back to the rich editor from the html
              editor when editing the page, you will see that the page doesn't
              load and that you can view the following indicating that the page
              couldn't be found:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-9.png"
            />
            <p>
              Don't worry about this message. Just make sure that when you save
              the page, you are able to view the html content you had previously
              created.
              <br />
              <br />
              This is the result of the example html file being included into a
              page:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc2-10.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now you are ready to upload any of your custom html files and view
              them directly as part of your course.

            <p>The course template is composed of 2 key parts:</p>

              <li>
                HTML files with different pages you may include in your course

              <li>
                General CSS file including styles applied to the HTML pages
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In this part of the documentation we are going to focus on the CSS
              file, what basic changes we can make to adapt the design to our
              brand colors and how and where we can include additional
              modifications.
              <br />
              <br />
              Let's start by opening the "general.css" file you should have
              found within the template files. If you are not sure how to open
              this file, please check the "View HTML" section of this
              documentation.
              <br />
              <br />
              Once you open it, you should be able to see something like the
              following:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-1.png"
            />
            <p>
              In this file I have already enable several combinations of colors
              described as "themes". You may view them within the different
              modules of this template course. So if you like any of the
              existing themes, the only thing you need to do is comment the code
              that is active and uncomment the theme you want to use.
              <br /><br />
              Let's go through an example:
              <br /><br />
              In the template, by default, you will see the following lines of
              code at the top of the document:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-2.png"
            />
            <p>
              With this initial css, if you load the frontpage, you should be
              able to view a content like the following one:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-3.png"
            />
            <p>
              If you are using a code editor, either locally or online, you will
              be able to differentiate between comments just by the color
              itself. Otherwise, if you are viewing the code in plain text, you
              can identify the comments because they start with "/*" and end
              with "*/". This is common to all css files. <br /><br />
              So after modifying the comments, the code should now look like
              this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              style="float: left"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-4a.png"
            />
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              style="float: right"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-4b.png"
            />
            <p>
              And this would be the resulting view of the web page when loaded:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-5.png"
            />
            <h3>How do I use my own colors?</h3>
            <p>
              As you have seen so far, modifying the colors is quite easy and
              fast. In order to customize these colors from the ones included in
              the template, we will be working with the same piece of code.
              <br /><br />
              Let's go back to the css code.
              <br /><br />
              Here you may see there are various elements that define the
              template. Let's focus on one of those lines to better understand
              it. For instance, the first line:
            </p>
            <samp>--main-color: #003057;</samp>
            <p>
              <br />
              This line is composed of 2 parts divided by a colon (":"). The
              first part includes the name of the variable that is then used
              along the rest of the css file and the second part defines the
              color, "#003057" in this case.
              <br /><br />
              Therefore, in order to modify the main color, we only need to
              modify that second part:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-6.png"
            />
            <p>
              Here, the colors are defined in hexadecimal format, but bear in
              mind that in css other formats are also accepted. You may learn
              more about this
              <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp"
                target="_blank"
                >here</a
              >. If you are not sure what colors to use in your course or what
              colors combine better with each other, you may take a look at the
              <a
                href="https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html"
                target="_blank"
                >tools for picking colors</a
              >
              in Google's Material design website, or at
              <a
                href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel"
                target="_blank"
                >Adobe's color website</a
              >. <br /><br />
              As an example, let's choose a red color as an alternative. The one
              I will be using has the following hexadecimal codification:
              <b>#F44336</b>. Now, after modifying the code we would end up with
              something like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-7.png"
            />
            <p>
              After saving the css file and uploading it again into canvas, we
              can see that the design has been modified and the result is the
              following:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-8.png"
            />
            <h3>How do I modify only one of the pages?</h3>
            <p>
              Imagine you have a design applied to all the pages, but there is
              one you want it to be different. The most straightforward and
              fastest way of doing so is by including some of the css parts into
              the specific html file.
              <br /><br />
              Let's go through an example. Getting back to the previous css code
              included in the general.css file, we can view the following code:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-9.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now, in order to just modify one of the pages, you may include the
              css code from the general.css file surrounded by "style" tags and
              then just customize whatever part you want. This is an example of
              how the code would look after including the color variables:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc3-10.png"
            />
            <p>
              So now, if we make any modifications over this code within the
              html file, it will only affect this one page and the remaining
              pages will still have the previous styling.
            </p>
            <h3>Can I include my own code?</h3>
            <p>
              Of course you can! What's even more, I encourage you to do so and
              you'll be able to create amazing things with it. Since this
              templates works by loading files into Canvas, you may include any
              parts accepted normally in any website. Therefore you could even
              include an additional JavaScript file with additional logic and
              functionality that may take your course even further.

            The template is composed of several parts and pieces each showing
            differently within the page when it is loaded in a browser.

            <iframe
              width="560"
              height="315"
              src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HoWDgnpsvs"
              title="YouTube video player"
              frameborder="0"
              allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"

          <div class="text-left">
            <p>
              The content within the page is divided into different parts, some
              are text, otheres are composed of images, and so on. In order to
              make it easier for you to identify which part is which, the code
              has been tagged to indicate which part it is representing. So when
              you open an html file, you will be able to view the different
              blocks faster and also if you want to mix things up, you can copy
              paste any of those blocks in a different page. This is an example
              of how the comments indicating such block look:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc4-1.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now, these blocks can be divided into 2 subsets. Depending on the
              type, you may need to carry out a different process if you want to
              use it somewhere else. These are individual blocks and group
              blocks.
            </p>

            <h3>Individual blocks</h3>
            <p>
              These are blocks composed of one single element and that aren't
              related to other elements within the page. You can copy these ones
              freely and paste them anywhere you want.
              <br />
              <br />
              To do so, simply copy from the starting comment down to the ending
              comment for that block and then paste it wherever you want to
              include it afterwards.
              <br />
              <br />
              Let's get into an example. We'll copy one of the boxes in the
              second tab of the frontpage. This is the code:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc4-2.png"
            />
            <p>And this is it's view:</p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc4-3.png"
            />
            <p>
              Then we will paste it under the video section of the page 1. Here
              is the resulting view:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc4-4.png"
            />

            <h3>Group blocks</h3>
            <p>
              These block can be a little bit more tricky. This is because they
              are composed of more than one part and they don't necessarily are
              one after the other. A clear example is the toolbar at the top of
              this page.
              <br /><br />
              Here you can see that there are several tabs/options and then each
              of the options has its own content. Therefore, when reusing these
              tabs you will have to copy 2 elements independently.
              <br />
              <br />
              First, there is the top bar itself with each of the elements. This
              is the one used in this page. I have collapsed all the elements
              and left the last one open so you may view its content:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc4-5.png"
            />
            <p>
              Secondly, the content itself. Here is the beginning of the content
              part:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc4-6.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now this content needs to be related to the top bar so when you
              click on one of the options, that element becomes viewable. This
              is done through the href field in the top bar element:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc4-7.png"
            />
            <p>And the id element in the content corresponding part:</p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc4-8.png"
            />
            <p>
              This way, whenever the option in the menu is clicked, the
              corresponding content will be shown in the page.
              <b
                >Pay attention to the href field, as the corresponding id from
                the content must be preceded by a hashtag symbol ("#")</b
              >. <br /><br />
              This are the main components building the page and now that you
              know how they work, you can use them freely around your course.
            </p>

          </div>

        <!-- Option content -->
        <div
          class="tab-pane fade show mx-auto description justify-content-center"
          id="link"

          <p class="lead">
            To relate content more easily within the course, you may use links
            to the different pages improving the user experience. Here is how
            you can do that.
            <hr>

          <div class="text-left mt-4">
            <p>
              In this part, we are going to go through the several different
              links you may want to use within your content. For instance, you
              may want to embed an image, show a video, link to another page or
              module, or link to a file you want the students to download from
              Canvas. In all of the cases, the content is stored within Canvas.
              <br /><br />
              I'll divide this into several parts that you may check depending
              on what it is you want to include.
            </p>
            <h3>Images</h3>
            <p>
              Including images in the html files is quite straightforward. Let's
              take a look at an example.
              <br /><br />
              Let's say we have the following file structure in Canvas:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-1.png"
            />
            <p>
              Here we want to upload an image into the
              <b>course-images</b> folder and then use it within our
              <b>frontpage.html</b> file which is in the route Example 1 >
              Example 2. <br /><br />
              So we'll upload the following image into Canvas:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Places/201611-S7II-Carcassonne_0150.JPG"
            />
            <p>This is how it will now look in the Files section:</p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-2.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now we'll go back to the frontpage.html file and open it in the
              second tab section where there are cards with images included in
              them, and we will modify the image in the first card:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-3.png"
            />
            <p>
              Here we'll modify the src part within the image tag. For doing so,
              we fist need to think on where the image is stored in relation to
              the html file. In this case, if we were to navigate from the html
              file to the image we would need to go up 2 folders (Example 2 and
              then Example 1), and then get into the course-images folder where
              the image is stored.
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-4.png"
            />
            <p>
              Therefore, for the route we need to specify 2 dots ".." per folder
              we need to move up and then the corresponding folder/s where the
              file is stored. So, in this case, the resulting route would be the
              following:
              <br /><br />
              <samp>../../course-images/201611-S7II-Carcassonne_0150.JPG</samp>
              <br />
              <br />
              And this would be the resulting code for the image:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-5.png"
            />
            <p>Now we update the html in Canvas and we can view the result:</p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-6.png"
            />
            <h3>Videos</h3>
            <p>
              The code to embed a video in the page may vary depending on the
              provider where the video is stored. Generally, the provider will
              give you some code you may just copy and paste into wherever you
              want within the html file. For instace, let's take a look at this
              <a href="https://youtu.be/cBTwuF3OcYQ" target="_blank">video</a>
              uploaded to YouTube.
              <br /><br />
              If you take a look at the sharing options, you may see there is
              one called "Embed":
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-7.png"
            />
            <p>
              Once you click on it, you will be able to view a piece of code
              beginning with "iframe":
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-8.png"
            />
            <p>
              You can just copy this code and then paste it in the corresponding
              html file. Once you're done, you should have something like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-9.png"
            />
            <p>
              Here you may see there are several parts composing this video such
              as the width and height of the box where the video will be
              presented within the page. For this template, the parts where
              videos have been included use a width of <b>560</b> and a height
              of <b>315</b>, but feel free to use whatever dimensions may suit
              you best. <br /><br />
              In case of embedding from a different website or video provider,
              you should find something similar, where the source url varies as
              well as some other aspects. Here is another example for a video
              stored in vimeo:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-10.png"
            />
            <p>As you can see, they are both quite similar.</p>
            <h3>Pages/Modules</h3>
            <p>
              When creating content that relates several pages/modules between
              each other, you may want to include links from one page to
              another.
              <br /><br />
              You can obtain these links very easily from the Canvas website in
              the following way:
            </p>
            <h4>Pages</h4>
            <p>
              To obtain the direct link to a page within Canvas, first access
              the Pages section in Canvas and view all pages:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-11.png"
            />
            <p>
              Then, find the page you want to link and right click on its name
              and then on copy link address:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-12.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now you can just go to your html file and include it wherever you
              want by using a hyperlink tag. Here is an example:
              <br /><br />
              <samp
                >&#60;a
                href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/123456/pages/my-new-course-page"&#62;Hyperlink
                text&#60;/a&#62;</samp
              >
            </p>
            <h4>Modules</h4>
            <p>
              The process for the modules is pretty similar to the one of pages,
              but instead you will have to access the modules section in Canvas:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-13.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now, just like with the pages, right click on the module you want
              to link and then on copy link address:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-14.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now you can just go to your html file and include it wherever you
              want by using a hyperlink tag. Here is an example:
              <br /><br />
              <samp
                >&#60;a
                href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/123456/modules/items/1574192"&#62;Hyperlink
                text&#60;/a&#62;</samp
              >
            </p>
            <h3>Files</h3>
            <p>
              You may also want to include files that have been uploaded to
              Canvas for students to download. One way to do this, is by
              creating a hyperlink tag (just like the one for pages/modules) and
              use a route that is obtained in the same way as for an image. That
              is, relative to the html file. Let's see an example.
              <br /><br />
              This is our current file structure within Canvas:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-15.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now we'll create a new folder within Example 1 and inside that
              folder store a .docx file named "file-test":
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-16.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now, just like we did with the images, we'll use 2 dots, "..", for
              each folder we need to move up and then we'll write the
              corresponding path to the file we have just stored:
              <br /><br />
              Therefore, the finel hyperlink would be something like this:
              <br /><br />
              <samp
                >&#60;a href="../file-test-folder/file-test.docx"&#62;Click to
                download file&#60;/a&#62;</samp
              >
              <br /><br />
              Now, if we add this to the frontpage.html file, we can see that
              when we click on the link, it automatically downloads the
              indicated file:
            </p>
            <img
              class="img-fluid full-image mb-4"
              src="../images/Documentation/doc5-17.png"
            />
            <p>
              Now you are ready to include any file within your course and have
              students download it in just 1 click.
