# Canvas Template for Online Courses

This project provides a template for teachers and course creators, specifically working within the Canvas environment. It intends to provide designs and resources outside the standard options available and to improve the user experience in online open courses.
The template is composed of the following elements:

  1. A home page with 4 sections:

        · General information regarding the course.

        · Content preview of each section/lecture within the course.

        · Team behind the course.

        · Frequently Asked Questions.


  2. Video Lecture grouping several videos in one single page and providing teacher's notes and link to discussion board.

  3. Project section for showing a specific assignment after a lecture.

  4. Components page with different elements available to be used within the course.

  5. Documentation. All the relevant information on how the template works and how to customize it to your own needs.

There are 3 themes available, each of them with a different color combination.
The different html files containing each of the sections in the course are distributed within each theme accordingly.

The file with the .imscc extension includes an export of the Canvas course which can be directly uploaded to any environment that supports uploading Canvas course files.
